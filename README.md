# System-Analysis-and-Design

Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The client was DriverPass. DriverPass wanted to assist new drivers in passing their DMV exams by providing online lessons and tests as well as instructor-led driving lessons. 

What did you do particularly well?
My Business Requirements Document was detailed.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
The activity diagram I did for the user login scenario did not include options for using a "forgot password" functionality. The Admin had to reset the password and this was the only way to regain access to the account. I would like include this function.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I interpreted the user's needs by reading over an interaction between members of my team and the client and taking notes on their expectations. It is important to address the client's needs sufficiently because they have come to us for a solution and we are in the business of solving problems. If we are not solving their problems we have not done our job.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
First, gather information to create lists of requirements. Use those requirements to create diagrams that will guide us in developing the system. These are the strategies I intend to use for future projects.
